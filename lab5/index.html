					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<h3>Leon</h3>
					<p>We worked together to do this assignment. I was inputting things into the html and javascript file 
						under lab 5. The only problems we ran across were due to the fact that we forgot some simple stuff 
						- like how to declare a boolean variable in JavaScript. We used WesBot to give us a quick answer.</p>
					
					<h3>Nate</h3>
					<p> We worked collaboratively on this assignment to produce the javascript for this lab. Since Javascript 
						is new to both of us at this point in the class, we took a bit more time to make sure we really understood it. 
						It came very easily due to the example that was given in class.
