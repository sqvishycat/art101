          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Write pseudocode for an everyday task and a simple game.</p>

          <p>I took the wheel and I was driving. I wrote the pseudocode 
            for how to make a cinnamon roll. Then as I added the pseudocode to 
            the lab4 html section on the website my partner wrote the pseudocode 
            for battleship. After he was done with that I then added the pseudocode 
            for battleship in the lab4 html section as well as the javascript section 
            (as comments). Nate suggested to include photos for the cinnamon roll and 
            battleship tasks so we spent some time looking for appropriate images and 
            then I used CSS to make them not super huge on the website. 
          </p>

            Once again for this assignment I took a leadership role. I wrote the 
            outline for the document, I broke down the tasks, and I wrote the pseudo 
            code for battleship. Then my partner wrote the code for the website under 
            my guidance.
